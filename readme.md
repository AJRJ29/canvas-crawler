# Canvas Crawler

Let's learn a bit about HTML5's canvas by making a super basic dungeon crawler!

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Getting Started

The provided template contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page.

***IF YOU HAVE NODE INSTALLED ALREADY and would like to use browsersync***

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the BrowserSync server

***OTHERWISE***

Ignore that mumbo jumbo and just dive in! The only files you'll need to worry about are: `index.html`, `img` folder, `css` folder.

## Goals

* Use HTML5 Canvas to make an "ogre" (this can just be a box) and a "hero" (this can also just be a box)
* Be able to move the Hero using key bindings (either WASD or the arrow keys)
* Detect a collision between the hero and the ogre
* Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style your game in the browser
